# The Eagle
The Eagle is a web-interface for eBay's API that shows your overall statistics and which you'll be able to (IN THE FUTURE) list items and message buyers.

I plan to add list item function later this week aswell as the messages function. The site uses JS & Python (with Flask), Python gets all the data, JS fetches the data.
You just need to add your eBay dev tokens and oauth token and you'll be able to see the statitics, you need to install Flask only.
